### What I learned

I've used SCSS for the first time to improve my knowledge
Function which I'm pround of (learnt how to use querySelectorAll):
  inPut[index].style.border="0.15px solid hsl(0, 100%, 74%)"

Now I understand functions a little more.

### Continued development

Get better with SCSS and undarstand how to deploy inserted data to server.
